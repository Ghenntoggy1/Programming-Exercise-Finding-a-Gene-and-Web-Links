PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Finding a Gene and Web Links"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use of String type variables. Find a gene in a DNA strand
                    by two algorithms (ATG...TAA type of DNA, but in Part2 you
                    can actually manually change the stop code from the 
                    corresponding java file). Another task was to find 
                    occurences of a string in another string and if those occurences
                    are at least 2, return value true, otherwise false. Also,
                    another task was to find the part of the string after a 
                    certain string (ex. The part of the string after an in banana is ana.)
                    Another task was to find all youtube links from a URL location.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej". 
                           Find inside of this project 4 classes: 
                           Part 1 - compile, create object of type Part1 and start function "testSimpleGene"; 
                           Part 2 - compile, create object of type Part2 and start function "testSimpleGene"; 
                           Part 3 - compile, create object of type Part3 and start function "testing".
                           Part 4 - compile, create object of type Part4 and start function "test".
